## 📘 Overview  
**AI SmartQuizzer** is an intelligent, adaptive quiz generation web application that personalizes learning experiences using AI.  
It dynamically generates questions from educational content (PDFs, URLs, or text) and adjusts quiz difficulty based on the learner’s performance.  

This project bridges the gap between **static quizzes** and **adaptive, AI-driven learning**, making self-assessment smarter and more engaging.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Dynamic Question Generation** – Automatically creates diverse question types (MCQs, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank).  
✅ **Adaptive Learning Engine** – Adjusts difficulty and question types based on user performance.  
✅ **Content Upload Support** – Upload PDFs, paste text, or fetch online content for question generation.  
✅ **AI-Powered Question Logic** – Uses **Groq API** for intelligent question generation.  
✅ **Web Scraping Support** – Extracts clean text from web pages using BeautifulSoup4.  
✅ **User Profiles & Performance Tracking** – Tracks accuracy and progress using SQLite.  
✅ **Responsive Interface** – Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean user experience.
